Compromise/Reconcile</li> </ul> </li> <li>Description: This technique involves finding a middle ground where each party gives up something to reach a mutually acceptable solution. It's often seen as a\u00a0lose-lose situation\u00a0because neither party gets everything they want.</li> <li>When to Use: Use compromise when both parties have\u00a0equal power and influence, and a\u00a0quick resolution is needed. It\u2019s suitable when the conflict involves\u00a0moderate importance issues.</li> <li>Levels of Influence and Power: This technique is effective when\u00a0both parties have similar levels of influence and power, making it easier to negotiate and reach a consensus. 2. Force/Direct</li> <li>Description: This technique involves pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others, leading to a\u00a0win-lose\u00a0situation. It is assertive and uncooperative, relying on\u00a0authority\u00a0to resolve the conflict.</li> <li>When to Use: Use this technique in\u00a0emergencies\u00a0or when\u00a0quick, decisive action is necessary. It is appropriate when the\u00a0stakes are high, and a decision must be enforced.</li> <li>Levels of Influence and Power: This technique is effective when the\u00a0person using it has high power and influence\u00a0over others, such as a\u00a0project manager or senior leader\u00a0imposing a decision. 3. Collaborate/Problem Solve</li> <li>Description: This technique involves working together to find a\u00a0win-win\u00a0solution that satisfies all parties. It is both\u00a0assertive and cooperative, focusing on understanding and addressing the underlying concerns.</li> <li>When to Use: Use collaboration when\u00a0the issue is too important for a compromise, and a long-term solution is needed. It is suitable for\u00a0complex problems\u00a0where different perspectives can lead to a better outcome.</li> <li>Levels of Influence and Power: This technique works best\u00a0when all parties involved have similar levels of power and influence, or when there is a\u00a0high level of trust\u00a0and openness in the team. 4. Smooth/Accommodate</li> <li>Description: This technique involves\u00a0emphasizing areas of agreement\u00a0rather than differences to maintain harmony and relationships. It often results in a\u00a0lose-win\u00a0situation, where one party gives in to the others.</li> <li>When to Use: Use smoothing\u00a0when the issue is more important to the other party\u00a0or\u00a0when maintaining relationships is more critical than resolving the conflict. It\u2019s suitable for\u00a0minor issues\u00a0or when the other party has a stronger position.</li> <li>Levels of Influence and Power: This technique is effective\u00a0when the person smoothing the conflict has less power and influence, or\u00a0when preserving relationships\u00a0is crucial for future collaboration. 5. Withdraw/Avoid</li> <li>Description: This technique involves postponing\u00a0or avoiding the conflict, hoping it will resolve itself or become irrelevant over time. It is\u00a0both unassertive and uncooperative.</li> <li>When to Use: Use withdrawal when\u00a0the issue is trivial, when\u00a0there\u2019s no chance of winning, or when\u00a0more time is needed\u00a0to prepare for a resolution. It\u2019s also appropriate if the conflict is part of a larger pattern that needs to be addressed later.</li> <li>Levels of Influence and Power: This technique can be used by anyone, regardless of their level of power and influence, but it\u2019s often employed when the\u00a0person has low power\u00a0or when the conflict is not worth the effort to engage.</li>

Projects","text":"<p>Predictive (Waterfall) Project Management Definition: Predictive project management, often referred to as the waterfall approach, is a linear and sequential method\u00a0where each phase of the project must be completed before the next phase begins. Characteristics: 1. Fixed Scope: The project scope, schedule, and cost are determined early in the project life cycle and are strictly followed. 1. Phase Sequence: Each phase (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing) must be completed before the next phase starts. 1. Detailed Planning:\u00a0Extensive planning is done upfront, and changes are managed through\u00a0formal change control processes. 1. Risk Management: Risks are identified and\u00a0managed through predefined plans. Advantages: * Clear structure and documentation. * Easy to manage and track progress. * Well-suited for projects with stable requirements. Disadvantages: * Inflexible to changes. * Can be slow to adapt to new information. * Risk of delivering a product that may no longer meet stakeholder needs due to changes in requirements over time.</p> <p>Adaptive (Agile) Project Management Definition: Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on\u00a0delivering small, usable segments\u00a0of the project to the customer for\u00a0feedback and continuous improvement. Characteristics: 1. Iterative Development: The project is divided into small cycles called iterations or\u00a0sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. 1. Incremental Deliverables: Working products are\u00a0delivered frequently, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments. 1. Flexibility: The approach\u00a0is highly adaptable to changes, with an emphasis on\u00a0responding to customer feedback\u00a0and changing requirements. 1. Collaboration: Agile promotes\u00a0close collaboration\u00a0between the project team and stakeholders. Advantages: * High adaptability to changes. * Continuous delivery of value to the customer. * Encourages stakeholder engagement and satisfaction. Disadvantages: * Can be challenging to manage without experienced teams. * Requires continuous stakeholder involvement. * May lead to scope creep if not properly managed. Key Concepts in Agile 1. Agile Manifesto:     * Values         * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools \u2013people &gt; process/tools         * Working software over comprehensive documentation \u2013it works &gt; documentation         * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation \u2013collaboration &gt; contract         * Responding to change over following a plan \u2013adaptability &gt; plans.     * Principles         * Satisfy the customer through early and\u00a0continuous delivery         * Welcome\u00a0changing requirements         * Deliver\u00a0working software\u00a0frequently         * Work together\u00a0daily with business people and developers         * Build projects around\u00a0motivated individuals         * Face-to-face\u00a0conversation is the best way to convey information         * Working software\u00a0is the primary measure of progress         * Maintain\u00a0a constant pace indefinitely         * Continuous attention to\u00a0technical excellence         * Simplicity\u00a0is essential         * The best architectures and designs emerge\u00a0from self-organizing teams         * Regularly reflect\u00a0and adjust to become more effective 1. Scrum Framework * Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team * Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment * Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective * Kanban: Visualization tool that uses a board to manage workflow and limit work in progress (WIP) * Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasizes customer satisfaction and focuses on\u00a0delivering software frequently and consistently with high-quality standards</p> <p>Comparison and Use Cases When to Use Predictive Approach: * Projects with\u00a0well-defined requirements and scope. * Low uncertainty and risk. * Stakeholders need a clear, linear plan. When to Use Agile Approach: * Projects with\u00a0high uncertainty and changing requirements. * Need for\u00a0frequent stakeholder feedback. * Emphasis\u00a0on rapid delivery\u00a0of\u00a0usable products. Hybrid Approach: * Combines elements of both predictive and agile approaches. * Suitable for projects where\u00a0some aspects are well-defined, while others require flexibility. Specific Techniques: * Rolling Wave Planning: Progressive elaboration where\u00a0detailed planning is done for the near term, and broader planning is done for the future. * Plan as you go, what happens gets rolled into the next plan. * Time-Boxing: Allocates\u00a0a fixed time period for activities, common in agile methods like Scrum. * Steel thread: E2E validation</p>"},{"location":"Types_of_leaders/","title":"Types of leaders","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Coercers</p> <ul> <li>Tell team members what to do and how to do</li> <li>Rarely listen and often seek little input from the team</li> <li>Micro-manager</li> <li>Never provide any type of reward and tend to give more negative feedback than positive feedback</li> <li>Have high standards</li> <li>Inflexible work environment</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Authoritarian</p> <ul> <li>Firm, but fair</li> <li>Tactful in providing clear directions but leave no doubt about what is expected</li> <li>Frequently solicit input from the team</li> <li>Explain the WHYs but always make final decision</li> <li>High standards as well as high clariity</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Affiliator</p> <ul> <li>People first</li> <li>Team member's comfort and happiness and their own personal popularity is the highest priority</li> <li>Do not provide clear directions</li> <li>Try to avoid conflicts</li> <li>No accountability</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Democrat</p> <ul> <li>Group participation and team based decision making</li> <li>Rewards average performance and rarely give negative feedbacks</li> <li>Do not hold team accountable for bad behaviour</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Pacesetter</p> <ul> <li>Would rather do the job themselves</li> <li>Loners </li> <li>Expect team to be self-directed</li> <li>Do not spend time mentoring</li> <li>rarely provide positive feedback</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Coach</p> <ul> <li>Primarily concerned with development of the project team</li> <li>Generally set high standard and work with the team to set those standards</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}]}
