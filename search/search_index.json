Characteristics: 1. Fixed Scope: The project scope, schedule, and cost are determined early in the project life cycle and are strictly followed. 1. Phase Sequence: Each phase (initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing) must be completed before the next phase starts. 1. Detailed Planning:\u00a0Extensive planning is done upfront, and changes are managed through\u00a0formal change control processes. 1. Risk Management: Risks are identified and\u00a0managed through predefined plans. Advantages: * Clear structure and documentation. * Easy to manage and track progress. * Well-suited for projects with stable requirements. Disadvantages: * Inflexible to changes. * Can be slow to adapt to new information. * Risk of delivering a product that may no longer meet stakeholder needs due to changes in requirements over time.</p> <p>Adaptive (Agile) Project Management Definition: Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on\u00a0delivering small, usable segments\u00a0of the project to the customer for\u00a0feedback and continuous improvement. Characteristics: 1. Iterative Development: The project is divided into small cycles called iterations or\u00a0sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. 1. Incremental Deliverables: Working products are\u00a0delivered frequently, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments. 1. Flexibility: The approach\u00a0is highly adaptable to changes, with an emphasis on\u00a0responding to customer feedback\u00a0and changing requirements. 1. Collaboration: Agile promotes\u00a0close collaboration\u00a0between the project team and stakeholders. Advantages: * High adaptability to changes. * Continuous delivery of value to the customer. * Encourages stakeholder engagement and satisfaction. Disadvantages: * Can be challenging to manage without experienced teams. * Requires continuous stakeholder involvement. * May lead to scope creep if not properly managed. Key Concepts in Agile 1. Agile Manifesto:     * Values         * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools \u2013people &gt; process/tools         * Working software over comprehensive documentation \u2013it works &gt; documentation         * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation \u2013collaboration &gt; contract         * Responding to change over following a plan \u2013adaptability &gt; plans.     * Principles         * Satisfy the customer through early and\u00a0continuous delivery         * Welcome\u00a0changing requirements         * Deliver\u00a0working software\u00a0frequently         * Work together\u00a0daily with business people and developers         * Build projects around\u00a0motivated individuals         * Face-to-face\u00a0conversation is the best way to convey information         * Working software\u00a0is the primary measure of progress         * Maintain\u00a0a constant pace indefinitely         * Continuous attention to\u00a0technical excellence         * Simplicity\u00a0is essential         * The best architectures and designs emerge\u00a0from self-organizing teams         * Regularly reflect\u00a0and adjust to become more effective 1. Scrum Framework * Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team * Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment * Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective * Kanban: Visualization tool that uses a board to manage workflow and limit work in progress (WIP) * Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasizes customer satisfaction and focuses on\u00a0delivering software frequently and consistently with high-quality standards</p> <p>Comparison and Use Cases When to Use Predictive Approach: * Projects with\u00a0well-defined requirements and scope. * Low uncertainty and risk. * Stakeholders need a clear, linear plan. When to Use Agile Approach: * Projects with\u00a0high uncertainty and changing requirements. * Need for\u00a0frequent stakeholder feedback. * Emphasis\u00a0on rapid delivery\u00a0of\u00a0usable products. Hybrid Approach: * Combines elements of both predictive and agile approaches. * Suitable for projects where\u00a0some aspects are well-defined, while others require flexibility. Specific Techniques: * Rolling Wave Planning: Progressive elaboration where\u00a0detailed planning is done for the near term, and broader planning is done for the future. * Plan as you go, what happens gets rolled into the next plan. * Time-Boxing: Allocates\u00a0a fixed time period for activities, common in agile methods like Scrum. * Steel thread: E2E validation</p>"},{"location":"Types_of_leaders/","title":"Types of leaders","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Coercers</p> <ul> <li>Tell team members what to do and how to do</li> <li>Rarely listen and often seek little input from the team</li> <li>Micro-manager</li> <li>Never provide any type of reward and tend to give more negative feedback than positive feedback</li> <li>Have high standards</li> <li>Inflexible work environment</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Authoritarian</p> <ul> <li>Firm, but fair</li> <li>Tactful in providing clear directions but leave no doubt about what is expected</li> <li>Frequently solicit input from the team</li> <li>Explain the WHYs but always make final decision</li> <li>High standards as well as high clariity</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Affiliator</p> <ul> <li>People first</li> <li>Team member's comfort and happiness and their own personal popularity is the highest priority</li> <li>Do not provide clear directions</li> <li>Try to avoid conflicts</li> <li>No accountability</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Democrat</p> <ul> <li>Group participation and team based decision making</li> <li>Rewards average performance and rarely give negative feedbacks</li> <li>Do not hold team accountable for bad behaviour</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Pacesetter</p> <ul> <li>Would rather do the job themselves</li> <li>Loners </li> <li>Expect team to be self-directed</li> <li>Do not spend time mentoring</li> <li>rarely provide positive feedback</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Coach</p> <ul> <li>Primarily concerned with development of the project team</li> <li>Generally set high standard and work with the team to set those standards</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}]}
