# Welcome to Lordfoulmouth's PMP Notes

For full documentation visit [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org).

## Commands

* These are notes that I prepared for my PMP exam.
  
## Project layout

The notes are divided in to different sections. I have tried to put all relevant notes for a section in its own page but it may not be perfect. 
Please use these notes only as a complementary resource with other content. It is no way a complete guide or resource for PMP exam.
