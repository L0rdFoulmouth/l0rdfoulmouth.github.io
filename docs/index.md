# Lordfoulmouth's PMP Notes

These are notes that I made and used for my own PMP exam. They are based on many online available resources - some of which are available for free on youtube videos from many creators.

  
## Project layout

* The notes are divided in to different sections
* I have tried to put all relevant notes for a section in its own page but it may not be perfect. 
* Please use these notes only as a complementary resource with other content. It is no way a complete guide or resource for PMP exam.
